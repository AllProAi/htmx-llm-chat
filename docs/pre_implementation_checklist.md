## Implementation Approval

All checklist items have been marked "approved". This document serves as formal approval to begin implementation of the Framer Motion LLM Chat App.

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow the technical requirements and design documents closely
2. Implement features according to the phasing strategy (MVP first)
3. Maintain modular, well-commented code
4. Regularly test across supported browsers
5. Prioritize accessibility throughout development

### First Development Milestones

1. Basic HTML/CSS structure with responsive design
2. Settings panel with API key management
3. Chat interface layout and styling
4. Integration with OpenAI API
5. Basic message animations with Framer Motion

## Architecture Compliance

The implementation will be regularly checked against:

- Design specifications in the design document
- Technical requirements
- Accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance targets (specified in technical requirements)

## Change Management

Any deviations from the approved requirements or design must be:

1. Documented
2. Justified
3. Approved before implementation
