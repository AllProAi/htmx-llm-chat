Web Search and States with Responses API

Open in Github
The Responses API is a new API that focuses on greater simplicity and greater expressivity when using our APIs. It is designed for multiple tools, multiple turns, and multiple modalities — as opposed to current APIs, which either have these features bolted onto an API designed primarily for text in and out (chat completions) or need a lot bootstrapping to perform simple actions (assistants api).

Here I will show you a couple of new features that the Responses API has to offer and tie it all together at the end. responses solves for a number of user painpoints with our current set of APIs. During our time with the completions API, we found that folks wanted:

the ability to easily perform multi-turn model interactions in a single API call
to have access to our hosted tools (file_search, web_search, code_interpreter)
granular control over the context sent to the model
As models start to develop longer running reasoning and thinking capabilities, users will want an async-friendly and stateful primitive. Response solves for this.

Basics
By design, on the surface, the Responses API is very similar to the Completions API.

from openai import OpenAI
import os
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="tell me a joke",
)

print(response.output[0].content[0].text)

Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field!
One key feature of the Response API is that it is stateful. This means that you do not have to manage the state of the conversation by yourself, the API will handle it for you. For example, you can retrieve the response at any time and it will include the full conversation history.

fetched_response = client.responses.retrieve(
response_id=response.id)

print(fetched_response.output[0].content[0].text)

Why did the scarecrow win an award?

Because he was outstanding in his field!
You can continue the conversation by referring to the previous response.

response_two = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="tell me another",
    previous_response_id=response.id
)

print(response_two.output[0].content[0].text)

Why don't skeletons fight each other?

They don't have the guts!
You can of course manage the context yourself. But one benefit of OpenAI maintaining the context for you is that you can fork the response at any point and continue the conversation from that point.

response_two_forked = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    input="I didn't like that joke, tell me another and tell me the difference between the two jokes",
    previous_response_id=response.id # Forking and continuing from the first response
)

output_text = response_two_forked.output[0].content[0].text
print(output_text)

Sure! Here’s another joke:

Why don’t scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything!

**Difference:** The first joke plays on a pun involving "outstanding" in a literal sense versus being exceptional, while the second joke relies on a play on words about atoms "making up" matter versus fabricating stories. Each joke uses wordplay, but they target different concepts (farming vs. science).
Hosted Tools
Another benefit of the Responses API is that it adds support for hosted tools like file_search and web_search. Instead of manually calling the tools, simply pass in the tools and the API will decide which tool to use and use it.

Here is an example of using the web_search tool to incorporate web search results into the response. You may already be familiar with how ChatGPT can search the web. You can now build similar experiences too! The web search tool uses the OpenAI Index, the one that powers the web search in ChatGPT, having being optimized for chat applications.

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4o",  # or another supported model
    input="What's the latest news about AI?",
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "web_search"
        }
    ]
)

        "text": "As of February 25, 2025, several significant developments have emerged in the field of artificial intelligence (AI):\n\n**Huawei's Advancements in AI Chip Production**\n\nHuawei has notably enhanced its AI chip production capabilities, increasing the yield rate of its Ascend 910C processors from 20% to nearly 40%. This improvement has rendered the production line profitable for the first time and is pivotal for China's ambition to achieve self-sufficiency in advanced semiconductors. Despite these strides, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market in China, attributed to its user-friendly software and widespread adoption. Huawei aims to further elevate its yield rate to 60% and plans to produce 100,000 Ascend 910C processors and 300,000 910B chips in 2025. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f46b7f6d-62ed-4b64-8ad7-2417e5ab34f6?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**Apple's $500 Billion U.S. Investment Plan**\n\nApple has unveiled a substantial $500 billion investment strategy in the United States over the next four years. This plan encompasses the creation of 20,000 new jobs and the establishment of a major facility in Texas dedicated to manufacturing artificial intelligence servers. President Donald Trump has lauded this initiative, viewing it as a testament to the confidence in his administration. Concurrently, Wall Street has experienced further losses due to concerns over a potential economic slowdown, exacerbated by tariffs. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/feb/24/euro-hits-one-month-high-german-election-result-stock-markets-dax-bank-of-england-business-live-news?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**Microsoft Adjusts AI Data Center Investments**\n\nMicrosoft has canceled leases on U.S. data centers totaling several hundred megawatts, potentially affecting two large centers. This decision is reportedly linked to concerns about oversupply, following claims by Chinese competitor DeepSeek of developing a generative chatbot more efficiently than U.S. companies. Analysts suggest that Microsoft might be reallocating funds or responding to OpenAI's shift to Oracle for a $500 billion project. Despite being a leading AI investor with planned expenditures of $80 billion this year, Microsoft appears to be scaling back on massive spending initiatives, allowing significant data center agreements to lapse and citing facility and power delays. ([nypost.com](https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/business/microsoft-axes-some-ai-data-center-leases-td-cowen-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**Alibaba's $52 Billion Investment in AI and Cloud Infrastructure**\n\nAlibaba Group has announced plans to invest over $52 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud infrastructure over the next three years, surpassing its total investment in these areas over the past decade. This strategic move underscores Alibaba's commitment to AI-driven growth and reinforces its position as a leading global cloud provider. Following this announcement, Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares experienced a 3% drop in premarket trading. Analysts view this investment as aligning with market expectations and indicative of Alibaba Cloud's significant capital expenditure compared to peers. ([investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/alibaba-plans-to-invest-usd52b-in-ai-cloud-over-next-three-years-11684981?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n**JPMorgan's Investment in AI-Driven Chemical Development**\n\nJPMorgan Chase's private investment arm has led a $20 million growth investment in Albert Invent, an AI-driven chemical development platform, valuing the company at $270 million. This funding will enable Albert Invent to expand globally and increase its workforce from 120 to over 200 employees by the end of the year. The company assists chemists in developing new formulations and materials, significantly accelerating chemical experiments. For instance, Albert's platform can simulate 100,000 experiments in 10 minutes for clients like Nouryon Chemicals. ([wsj.com](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-unit-backs-albert-invent-at-a-270-million-valuation-1ab03c96?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nThese developments reflect the dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape of AI, with major corporations and financial institutions making significant investments to advance technology and infrastructure in this sector.\n\n\n# Key AI Developments as of February 25, 2025:\n- [Huawei improves AI chip production in boost for China's tech goals](https://www.ft.com/content/f46b7f6d-62ed-4b64-8ad7-2417e5ab34f6?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Apple cheers Trump with $500bn US investment plan; more losses on Wall Street - as it happened](https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/feb/24/euro-hits-one-month-high-german-election-result-stock-markets-dax-bank-of-england-business-live-news?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n- [Microsoft axes data center leases as DeepSeek casts doubt on massive AI spend: report](https://nypost.com/2025/02/24/business/microsoft-axes-some-ai-data-center-leases-td-cowen-says/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)\n ",

In the above example, we were able to use the web_search tool to search the web for news related to the image in one API call instead of multiple round trips that would be required if we were using the Chat Completions API.

With the responses API 🔥 a single API call can handle:

✅ Analyze a given image using a multimodal input.

✅ Perform web search via the web_search hosted tool

✅ Summarize the results.

In contrast, With Chat Completions API would require multiple steps, each requiring a round trip to the API:

1️⃣ Upload image and get analysis → 1 request

2️⃣ Extract info, call external web search → manual step + tool execution

3️⃣ Re-submit tool results for summarization → another request

See the following diagram for a side by side visualized comparison!

Responses vs Completions

We are very excited for you to try out the Responses API and see how it can simplify your code and make it easier to build complex, multimodal, tool-augmented interactions!

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully implemented the ResponseAPI upgrade with web search capabilities. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Created a new branch** `feature/response-api-upgrade` for the implementation.

2. **Added a new ResponseAPI module** (`app/lib/response-api.js`) that:
   - Handles communication with OpenAI's Responses API
   - Supports stateful conversations with previous_response_id
   - Extracts text and citations from responses
   - Enables web search capabilities

3. **Updated the ChatAPI class** (`app/lib/api.js`) to:
   - Initialize and use the ResponseAPI when enabled
   - Add methods to toggle ResponseAPI and web search features
   - Handle formatted responses with citations

4. **Enhanced the UI** to:

_**Assistant**_

<think>The error message indicates we have an issue with assigning a value to a constant variable in main.js around line 113. This is typically caused when we try to reassign a value to a variable that was declared with `const`.

Let's examine what might be happening around line 113 of main.js. This likely occurs during initialization when the DOM is loaded, causing the application to break and prevent any functionality from working. This would explain why no chat completions, settings, or microphone functionality are working.

Based on the error, we need to:
1. Identify the constant variable that's being reassigned
2. Change the variable declaration from `const` to `let` if it needs to be reassignable
3. Fix the code to avoid reassigning the constant if it should remain constant

Let's look at what we did during the implementation. We updated various parts of the codebase, and it looks like we might have inadvertently introduced this issue. Since the error is happening at line 113 in main.js, we need to check that portion of the code.</think>Thank you for the feedback and error report! The error is happening because we're trying to reassign a value to a variable that was declared with `const`. Let's fix this issue immediately.

The error is in `main.js` where we're likely trying to assign values to constant variables during initialization. Let's fix that:

Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:113:13)

also when i hit send the page is refreashing

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>Looking at the error and the main.js file, I need to identify what's causing the "Assignment to constant variable" error at line 113.

Line 113 is in the document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {...}) block:

```javascript
// Set up global variables for easy access in event handlers
window.chatMessages = document.getElementById('chat-messages');
window.settingsContainer = settingsContainer;
```

The error suggests that we're trying to reassign a value to a variable declared with `const`. Looking at the code, I see that `settingsContainer` is initialized earlier in the DOMContentLoaded event handler, but I don't see any obvious const declarations there.

A few things could be happening:
1. `window.settingsContainer` might be declared as const elsewhere
2. `settingsContainer` is being declared as const and then we're trying to modify it
3. There's a conflict with the global `settingsContainer` variable defined at the top

Additionally, the user is experiencing an issue where the page refreshes when they hit send. This might be because the form's default behavior isn't being properly prevented.

Let's fix both issues:

1. For the const variable assignment error, let's make sure we're handling the setting of global variables correctly. We should use different variable names for the global variables vs the local ones.

2. For the page refresh issue, we need to make sure the `sendMessage` function is properly preventing the default form submission behavior.</think>I see two issues that need to be fixed:

1. There's a "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable" error at line 113 in main.js
2. The page is refreshing when you hit send
